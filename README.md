# SNAKE Game with C++ openGL
A  desktop stylized version of snake game made from scratch in C++/OpenGL.
This is the same snake game we all played in our childhood .

## Skills
* C++ 
* OpenGL-freeglut

## Prerequisites
- You should install MINGW Compiler for C++ Programming.
- CODEBLOCKS-IDE

## RULES : 
* Main objective is to eat the food.
* Use UP(^), DOWN(v), RIGHT(>), and LEFT(<) arrow keys to move your snake.
* Try neither to CRASH with the WALLS nor with your BODY.
* The more you eat the prey, your score increases and the bigger you become.
